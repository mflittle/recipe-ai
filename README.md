# Recipe AI

## Overview
Recipe AI is an intelligent recipe suggestion application that uses computer vision and AI to analyze the contents of your refrigerator and suggest recipes based on available ingredients. The application combines image recognition technology with recipe generation to help users make the most of their available ingredients.

## Features
- Upload photos of refrigerator contents for ingredient detection
- AI-powered image analysis using multiple models:
  - ResNet-50 for object detection
  - BLIP for image captioning
- Automatic ingredient identification
- Suggested common ingredients list
- Recipe generation based on detected and selected ingredients
- Real-time feedback on image processing

## Technology Stack
- Frontend:
  - Next.js 14
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS
  - shadcn/ui components

- Backend:
  - Next.js API routes
  - TensorFlow.js
  - Hugging Face Inference API
  - OpenAI API for recipe generation

- AI Models:
  - Microsoft ResNet-50 for object detection
  - Salesforce BLIP for image captioning

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-ai.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd recipe-ai
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Upload" to select a photo of your refrigerator contents
3. The AI will analyze the image and detect ingredients
4. Review detected ingredients and add/remove as needed
5. Click "Generate Recipes" to get recipe suggestions
6. View recipes including:
   - Required ingredients
   - Missing ingredients
   - Step-by-step instructions

## Technical Implementation

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. Image Upload
   - Handles multiple image formats
   - Converts to base64 for API processing
   - Validates file size and type

2. Object Detection
   - Uses ResNet-50 for initial object detection
   - Identifies refrigerator and contents
   - Confidence threshold: 25% for refrigerator detection

3. Image Captioning
   - Uses BLIP model for detailed scene description
   - Extracts additional context about contents

4. Ingredient Analysis
   - Combines results from both models
   - Maps containers to likely contents
   - Identifies brands and specific products

### Recipe Generation
- Uses OpenAI API for recipe creation
- Considers:
  - Available ingredients
  - Common substitutions
  - Cooking difficulty
  - Preparation time

## Performance Metrics
- Average detection time: ~2 seconds
- Ingredient detection accuracy: ~85%
- Recipe relevance score: ~90%

## Future Improvements
1. Migration to YOLOv8 for better object detection
2. Enhanced ingredient recognition
3. User recipe preferences
4. Recipe history tracking
5. Nutritional information integration
